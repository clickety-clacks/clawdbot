- **Upstream:** `upstream/main` @ `9e7aab9ba`
- **Merge base:** `9e7aab9ba`
- **Conflicts:** yes (multiple during rebase; resolved by preferring upstream, skipping non-essential churn commits, and restoring unrelated files to upstream)
- **Verdict:** PASS

## Divergence Snapshot

| Metric                     | This Rebase | Previous | Trend |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ----- |
| Total files diverged       | 18          | —        | —     |
| Files we added (ours)      | 18          | —        | —     |
| Upstream files we modified | 0           | —        | —     |
| Lines added                | 1960        | —        | —     |
| Lines removed              | 0           | —        | —     |

## Verification Results

### 1. Minimize Divergence

- Unjustified divergences: none
- Files restored to upstream: all non-Clawline-extension divergences (184 files) restored

### 2. Prefer Upstream Patterns

- New upstream patterns found: extension-oriented channel/provider integration and OpenClaw naming/layout alignment
- Patterns we adopted: isolated Clawline to `extensions/clawline/*`; removed core-tree Clawline implementation drift
- Deprecations found: legacy core Clawline file set in `src/clawline/*` no longer aligned with upstream pattern

### 3. No Invented Core Hooks

- Upstream files modified: none

### 4. Restore Rule

- Files restored: all non-extension Clawline divergences were restored to upstream state

## Notable Upstream Changes

- Upstream includes broad ongoing changes across channel/plugin infrastructure, gateway internals, docs, and extension organization.
- Rebase required dropping/reconciling old fork-era compatibility and rebase-churn commits to align with current upstream structure.

## Merge Difficulty

- High conflict volume during replay (273 commits), including repeated modify/delete conflicts and one broad churn commit that was skipped.
- Additional post-rebase reconciliation was required to enforce strict divergence hygiene.

## Lessons

- Prefer upstream-first conflict strategy (`-Xtheirs`) for this fork.
- Keep Clawline isolated as an extension; avoid core-file coupling.
- Run divergence audit against `upstream/main` before finalizing to catch residual drift early.
